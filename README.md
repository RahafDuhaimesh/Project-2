# Project-2
My second project in Orange Coding Academy is "Agate Coffee Shop" using Figma. It contains organic coffee products made in Jordan, I made main page, services page, login page, sign up page, and payment page. This project improves my skills in using colors, shapes, and photos in modern and attractive way.
