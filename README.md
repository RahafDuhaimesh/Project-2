# Project-2
My second project in Orange Coding Academy is "Agate Coffee Shop" using Figma. It contains organic coffee products made in Jordan, I made main page, services page, login page, sign up page, and payment page. This project improves my skills in using colors, shapes, and photos in modern and attractive way.

Check the project on Figma:
